Sorry for the delayed update--yet again! I had to suck it up and force myself to do an entire page of backgrounds. In trying to motivate myself, I realized that I was just being impatient and I used to get a lot more satisfaction out of meticulous, but careful, drawing and doodling. These days my main struggle is to just slow down, pay attention to what I'm doing and start enjoying it again.

Anyway, I'm also struggling with my routine, but hopefully I'll be getting pages out regularly!
